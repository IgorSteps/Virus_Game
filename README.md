"Virus Game" 

Simple 2D game in C++ and OpenGL about virus that eats healthy cells and grows. There might be an issue that when you spawn at the beginning your enemy is spaw at your position which kills you before you start playing, I am working to resolve that issue.
<br />Controls are:
<br />"S" - start
<br />"ESC" - exit game
<br />Move your mouse to move the virus
